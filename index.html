passionate about artificial intelligence and computer games design. Photography, philosophy,
mastering the art of the yoyo, and playing computer games are some of my other interests. 
Above all else I love learning. </p>

		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<h3>Mech Soldier</h3>
		<p>A 3D first-person shooter game made by myself and a colleague, Sean Van 
Duffelen. We used Unity3D to make the game, obtaining visual assets and some audio assets 
from 
the Unity 
store, with music and other audio assets from a spectacular team of contributors from the UCT 
school of music. To download a windows version of the game, please click here: <a
